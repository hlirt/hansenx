## Exploring, Visualizing, and Predicting Uber Trips in NYC
![](images/Uber_Logo.jpg)

Uber is a popular ride-hailing platform that connects passengers with drivers through its mobile app. Unlike traditional taxi services, Uber does not own any vehicles. Instead, it operates as a digital marketplace where riders can book trips with independent drivers using their personal vehicles. For drivers, Uber offers a flexible earning opportunity, while for passengers, it provides a convenient and often more affordable transportation option.

This project focuses on the exploration and visualization of Uber trips in New York City during 2023. It aims to provide actionable insights into spatial and temporal trip patterns, travel demand fluctuations, and predictions of Uber trips in different regions. These insights can help Uber drivers identify high-demand areas and improve their efficiency. The data used in this project primarily come from [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission](https://www.nyc.gov/tlc), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and [the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), providing detailed information about trip origins, destinations, fares, trip distances, durations, and demographics.

This project is divided into 3 main parts:

- Exploratory Analysis of Uber Trips in NYC

- Spatial Analysis of High-Demand Zones

- Uber Trips Prediction for Drivers in Manhattan
